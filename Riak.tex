Riak is a new, open-source NoSQL database system. Data is stored in key-value
format like {\bf LevelDB} or {\bf Bitcask} for fast access. To query data, Riak
provides REST-ful APIs via HTTP or Protocol Buffer with PUT/GET/POST/DELETE
functions. To search the data, we can use Apache Solr engine and MapReduce.
