Unlike a table in a traditional relational database systems (MySQL, Oracle,
\ldots), the table in Bigtable is totally different. 
A table in Bigtable is a
sparse, distributed, persistent multidimensional sorted map, which is indexed by
a row key, column key, and a timestamp.
It is aka 
key-value store, a column-family-oriented database, and sometimes a database
storing versioned maps of maps.
