Information retrieval (IR) is an activity to extract information relevant to a
given information from a collection of information resources. The search can be based
on {\it metadata} or full-text (or other content-based) indexing. When the data
is huge, {\bf automated information retrieval} is important.

The idea of using computer to do IR started as early as 1945, from an article
``As We May Think'' by Vannevar Bush. The first automated IR was built in 1950s
and 1960s. Web-search engine is a form of very-large scale IR applications.

To do automated IR, the documents are often transformed or represented in some
form. This is called a model and is categorized according to 2 dimensions: {\it
mathematical basis} and the {\it properties of the model},
