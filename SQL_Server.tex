During setup, you need to choose how to authenticate with the Database Engine. There are two ways
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Windows Authentication, i.e. using user's Windows logon account
  
  \item Mixed mode, i.e. enable both Windows Authentication and SQL Server Authentication.
\end{enumerate}
NOTICE: Windows Authentication is always enabled and cannot be disabled.

The built-in SQL Server system admin account is named \verb!sa!, and you need to set a strong password for 
this account when Mixed mode is used. If Windows Authentication mode is selected,
the \verb!sa! account is also created during setup, but it is disabled. The reason for not using Mixed mode
is that the account name is well-known and thus can be a good target for hacking.
