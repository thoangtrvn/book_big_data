\chapter{Impala and PrestoDB}
\label{chap:Impala}

Impala provides a SQL-like system with real-time processing on HDFS data. Hive
also provides SQL-like interface, but it is built on top of MapReduce which
means it does not do real-time processing, i.e. batch processing instead. 
Facebook built Hive on MapReduce early because it was the shortest path to SQL
on Hadoop. A newer generation, built from scratch by Facebook with SQL-like
real-time processing engine is called {\bf PrestoDB} (Sect.\ref{sec:PrestoDB}).
